Meta: It is an HTML tag that contains metadata about a webpage. 
They are used by search engine to determine the page content and how to treat a webpage.
Charset: It is an attribute that tells your browser what character encoding to use for this webpage to show the content as desired.
UTF-8: It is the version of the character set.
This meta tag is responsible for encoding these emojis into a machine-readable character and vice-versa. 
Most websites these days have to display characters which are not traditional ASCII characters. 
When received such characters in HTML source, Browsers should be able to handle those to display properly.
The UTF-8 character set covers all characters and symbols that exists in this universe. 
So, it only makes sense to use it to make your site be perceived as it is desired. 
You want to use an emoji or character, make your site look modern and graphical, UTF-8 will achieve this for You.
Thank you
